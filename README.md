# Agile7 Code Platform (ACP) – Whitepaper

**Open-source whitepaper showcasing the Agile7 Code Platform (ACP), an AI-driven no-code platform that ensures product requirements-to-code alignment while maintaining software architecture models as the single source of truth.**

---

## Overview

The Agile7 Code Platform (ACP) is a proof-of-concept open-source platform developed by Max Meinhardt, founder of Agile7. ACP transforms enterprise software development by enforcing consistent alignment between:

- **Product Requirements (PRD)**
- **System Architecture**
- **Generated Code**

Using UML models and supporting scripts as the authoritative source of truth, ACP prevents scope creep, architectural drift, and misalignment. It integrates **Business Requirements Validation (BRV)** to track alignment metrics and enforce fidelity between requirements and code.

## Features Highlighted in the Whitepaper

- AI-first code generation for microservices, agentic systems, and more  
- Requirements-to-code alignment enforced with scoring metrics  
- Visual dashboards for managers and product owners to track alignment in real time  
- Open-source, scalable, and model-driven architecture approach  
- Designed to replace manual coding while maintaining traceability and precision
